[h1]What Is This?[/h1]

This mod adds music cassettes to the game, along with a boombox, a walkman, and the ability to play music in cars.

My mod comes with a few copyright-free classical music tracks and some of my own music, but you will have to add your own music cassettes if you want to expand the list.

The good news is this is pretty easy to do - there is a guide on my GitHub: https://github.com/ZenarchistCode/ZenModPack/wiki/Zen's-Music-Mod

Unlike other music mods on the workshop, playing music with this mod will sync to all clients (so if you drive up to a player or a player logs in mid-song, they'll hear what you're hearing).

[h1]Installation Instructions:[/h1]

Install this mod like any other mod - copy it into your server folder and add it to your mods list. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys if you're not using a server management tool like OmegaManager which does that automatically.

This server must be run on both the client and the server.

A JSON config file for adjusting this mod's settings will be automatically created in server_profiles/Zenarchist/ZenMusicConfig.json

Here are some instructions for the config file: https://github.com/ZenarchistCode/ZenModPack/wiki/Zen's-Music-Mod

[h1]Repack & Source Code:[/h1]

You can repack this mod if you like, and do anything else you want with it for that matter. The source code is on my GitHub at www.zenarchist.com

[h1]Buy Me A Coffee:[/h1]

All my mods are free and open source, but it takes an enormous amount of time to put some of these mods together. If I've helped you out, please consider helping me buy my next coffee! I don't expect it, but I very much appreciate it.
